Going through the nooks and cavities of [Nemo's website](https://captnemo.in/), I found a perfect addition to Fragments. Based on the same principle of leeching off of Big Techs' resources, [Utterances](https://utteranc.es/) is a simple solution for adding comments on websites.

#### How It Works:

A simple widget with no backend, stores all the comments as GitHub issues. You can embed it with a one-liner; behind the scenes, calls the GitHub API; You provide the repo path and done.

Just wanted to share how a simple no backend solution helped me add comments. Feel free to comment, would love to know about even cooler tools available.
