### The Origins of -fragment(s) and why??

One thing AI has advanced in is consuming the soul out of the communities and platforms built with human ideas, creativity and passion. YouTube feels like a graveyard cleansed of all the spirits. Instagram, a doomscrolling finger exercise and Twitter, a kink dealer for all the discord mods.

Fragments is my S3. I will share not just my thoughts but also my creations. I used to love posting stuff on IG before i got bored of it and obviously got occupied with my finger exercises. This will serve as my new dumping ground of thoughts and ideas for me and all of you to see.

I love to experiment with different mediums be it code, visual and sometimes music. Fragments was one of those experiments, a friend asked me what would be the easiest way to create and publish blogs. Let me explain how this works. This current article is part of a git repository, I wrote this in Obsidian as a markdown file pushed to git and my frontend calls for that file. The metadata is stored in what is called a frontrunner. It acts as a metadata for this file which is stored on top of this file. This is how i am using github as a database for this.

Thanks for reading, will keep posting stuff here. You can call this as a portfolio not just a professional but personal as well. I prefer human generated slop to the one generated by a machine. So that is what i will contribute to.
