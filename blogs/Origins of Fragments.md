### The Origins of -fragment(s) and Why??

One thing AI has advanced in is consuming the soul out of the communities and platforms built with human ideas, creativity, and passion. YouTube feels like a graveyard cleansed of all the spirits. Instagram, a doomscrolling finger exercise, and Twitter, a kink dealer for all the Discord mods.

Fragments is my S3. I will share not just my thoughts but also my creations. I used to love posting stuff on IG before I got bored of it and obviously got occupied with my finger exercises. This will serve as my new dumping ground of thoughts and ideas for me and all of you to see.

I love to experiment with different mediums, be it code, visual, or sometimes music. Fragments is one of those experiments; a friend asked me what would be the easiest way to create and publish blogs. Let me explain how this works. This current article is part of a git repository; I wrote this in Obsidian as a markdown file pushed to git, and my frontend calls for that file. The metadata is stored in what is called a front matter. It acts as metadata for this file, which is stored on top of this file. This is how I am using GitHub as a database for this.

update:

After deploying my blog to production, I faced a rate limit on GitHub. I had planned to add server-side caching to this but did not expect the limit to hit so soon. I implemented a few things:
- Previously the homepage called the repo folder (1 call) + and reads all the metadata for each file ( n calls ). So now i maintain a blog.json in the blog repo. It stores all the metadata of all the blogs. When i make add another blog, a pre-commit hook updates the blog.json to add the metadata. This reduces the homepage call to just 1.
- Secondly, without a personal access token github rate limits the calls to 60 requests/hr. After adding the token the limit is 5000/hr.
- There was no caching so i added a 5 min caching to homepage api and 10 min caching per blog.

After these changes I hope my website can handle the 0 number of users it will have per day :)

Thanks for reading; I will keep posting stuff here. You can call this a portfolio, not just professional but personal as well. I prefer human-generated slop to the one generated by a machine. So that is what I will contribute to.
